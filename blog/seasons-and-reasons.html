						<p>I had this beautiful but daring idea of starting on my on for a while now but never quite found the nerve to do it.</p>
						<p>I did muster all my courage on a very random and plain day of autumn, when I felt I can no longer postpone the beginning of what I hope to be a beautiful story.</p>
						<p>I had a long list of great possible names for the future company which I have reaserched for weeks. Do I commit some copy infringement? Are there companies named like that already? Do we have a similar vision for weddings? Is it too long to remember? I went on like that for a while until I came to a brilliant idea on how to make my choice simple: I only had to ask myself what would be my favorite kind of wedding to plan, assist or to attend.</p>
						<p>Well, easy, I said to myself: <a href="https://www.pinterest.dk/weddingseason_events/fall-wedding/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Our autumn wedding board on pinterest">a fall wedding</a>! I have been <a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/articles/all-about-pins" rel="external" target="_blank">pinning</a> beautiful autumn wedding boards ever since I have got into <cite>Pinterest</cite>. Pumpkin, apple and leaf decorations, delicious pies or cider stations, harvest themed weddings, blankets to snuggle up and other cozy details have me head over hills with autumn weddings.</p>

						</div>
						
						<p>But then I remembered how many amazing <a href="https://www.pinterest.dk/weddingseason_events/winter-wedding/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Our winter wedding board on pinterest">winter wonderland weddings</a> I have seen. The wedding gowns are simply gorgeous for this season, long sleeves and knitted capes or furry shawls, red and green bow ties. Oh, I do love the winter outfits the best.</p>
						<p>They add a fairytale note naturally. Oh, and the many things you can do in matters of decorations: the beautiful Christmas tree under which you can gather all your wedding gifts, the cones sitting plan, the mistletoe, the frosty glasses, and not to forget: the music. This is the only season that has its own tune, how special is that?</p>

						<p>After not too large of an imagination excercise <a href="https://www.pinterest.dk/weddingseason_events/spring-wedding/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Our spring wedding board on pinterest">spring blossoms</a> came to mind. Greenery decor is regarded as the unmatched sight for any wedding. The must-have floral accessories, the pale tones, the outdoor ceremony, the canap√©s and cocktail bars? Again, enchanting, but how to choose?</p>
						
						<div class="row center-xs">
							<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10">
								<a data-pin-do="embedPin" data-pin-width="medium" data-pin-terse="true" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/714524297105014151/"></a>

						<p>But the most popular season has always been, <a href="https://www.pinterest.dk/weddingseason_events/summer-wedding/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Our summer wedding board on pinterest">summer</a>, and rightfully so: how swoony are the summer weddings with the long nights, romantic lighting, flowy dresses, festival vibe?</p>
						
						<div class="row center-xs">
							<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10">
								<a data-pin-do="embedPin" data-pin-width="medium" data-pin-terse="true" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/714524297105011538/"></a>

						<h2>And here I was in a conundrum. What's THE season?</h2>
						
						<p>And here's my answer: wedding season is all year round! There are endless possibilities of making your day extra-ordinary regardless of the time of year, moreover, enhanced by it.</p>
						<p>So my advice is this: embrace your favorite season and don't wait for the availability of the venue, or summer holidays, or <i>"we couldn't find another date"</i>. And most importantly, don't take summer because everyone else does. Just choose the season that feels most personal to you and the rest will come along, the budget, the atmosphere, the decorations and <a href="/about/meet-alexa.html" title="Meet Alexa, the person behind this tiny company">I</a>.</p>
						<p>So this is how I came up with <strong>Wedding Season</strong>. As reminder that every season is simply, naturally magical! Each with its personality, richness and variety. I am here to tell you that you can borrow this unmatched charm for your wedding day, that you should delight in it and celebrate authenticity.</p>

# Wedding Venues and their respective themes

Now that you, hopefully, got a [clearer idea](http://weddingseason.events/blog/how-to-choose-your-wedding-venue-part-one.html) of what you would like your wedding day to represent- a family bash in the country, 
an urban soiree at an art gallery, or an adventure cross state, it feels like the day is getting contour, isn't it?
What's left is to create the atmosphere you want to share and enjoy with your guests. And for that you need decor and styling efforts.

So, throughout this post I will draw a layout of the most distinguished wedding styles and their corresponding venues. 

To bring across this very difficult task, I will create a mood board and share heaps of pictures so you get the feel rather than give you a list
of items to buy, even though I will do that as well. :satisfied:
Shall we?
It is a challenging task- accurately defining a theme or set its boundaries because frequently elements of decor overlap 
and often sometimes, a specific theme is a polished version (over many wedding seasons) of an overarching atmosphere 
like we will see later on.

Another reason could be that most of the couples nowadays prefer to customize their wedding day decor, so they might choose only a *feel*,
if you will, and then just add themselves in the frame. And I davice you to the same. 
However I will try to the best of my abilities to pin point the key elements of the the most known (and used) themes and the rest is 
and should be **you**.

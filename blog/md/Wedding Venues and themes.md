# Wedding Venues and their respective themes

Now that you, hopefully, got a [clearer idea](http://weddingseason.events/blog/how-to-choose-your-wedding-venue-part-one.html) of what you would like your wedding day to represent- a family bash in the country, 
an urban soiree at an art gallery, or an adventure cross state, it feels like the day is getting contour, isn't it?

What's left is to create the atmosphere you want to share and enjoy with your guests. And for that you need decor and styling efforts.

So, throughout this post I will draw a layout of the most distinguished wedding styles and their corresponding venues. 

To bring across this very difficult task, I will create a mood board and share heaps of pictures so you get the feel rather than give you a list
of items to buy, even though I will do that as well. :satisfied:

Shall we?
It is a challenging task- accurately defining a theme or set its boundaries because frequently elements of decor overlap 
and often sometimes, a specific theme is a polished version (over many wedding seasons) of an overarching atmosphere 
like we will see later on.

Another reason could be that most of the couples nowadays prefer to customize their wedding day decor, so they might choose only a *feel*,
if you will, and then just add themselves in the frame. And I advice you to the same. 
However, I will try to pin point the key elements of the the most known (and used) themes and the rest is 
and should be **you**.

The venues could be split in two, the conventional ones, that we know for years and have been widely used, such as castles, country houses, or the famous (renovated) barns and lodges. We can include here the private houses, ranches or farms. Actually that's how it all started, with a bash in a backyard.

Then, we have the uncoventional ones, which the creatives of the day made trendy, these are becoming widely spread and booked all over. 
Into these category fall: museums, art galleries, the conservatories, renovated buildings. 
I know a couple that got married in a repuposed train station. That pretty much set up the theme, huh? The original train tracks were embelishing the floor and small details were a integrated part of decor, such as the station's clock, the rough edges of the space or the exposed red brick of the walls. Quaint and absoultely unique and lovely.

And the list continues, famous libraries can be a unique place to get hitched, also the theaters or your favorite quirky restaurant in town. I beleive there's a perfect venue for every couple's aestethic needs.

Why I emphasize on choosing your venue before your theme or drawing the vision for styling is because sometimes, the venues cannot be very flexible in regards to decor or even administrative issues. Can you bring your own catering company or do you have to hire the one on the premises? Is just one of the many questions that should get you venue scounting befor anything else.

## Popular wedding themes

1. Classy, elegant, timeless.

- Venue recommendation: a castle, a manor house, a very fancy hotel, or a country house.
- General feel: this theme has a royal aspect, clean cuts, pale colours, elegant flowers in matching tones, tall flower arrangements, crystal glassware. It is advisable to not have any decor elements that stand-out but rather all pieces work well together and complement each other. This theme should remind you of the old, royal ballrooms. 
It usually has a well defined dress-code, a sit-down meal and I would say this is the most formal type of nuptials you can plan. 
I suggest to not ask for craft beer.


2. Vintage glam, 1920's
- Venue recommendations: any conventional space will do. But to do proper justice to the Roaring 20s, your venue should ring of the beginnings of Plaza Hotel New York, Waldorf Astoria or The Savoy. It doesn't have to be a hotel though, you can bring the 20's glamour in any of the above mentioned space.
- General feel: Jay Gatsby's infamous partie; gold touches, monogramed items (the must have tier cake could be one of them, napkins, or even plates), statement flower arrangements, dark, moody, metallic colours, play with lighing.
If you want to go full Fitzgerald, get follow the 20's dress- code, or else your formal wear will do. 
A jazz band eoulf create the desire atmosphere.

3. Retro (the 50's and up)
- Venue Recommendation: country house, an up-to-date barn, a tipi, a backyard
- General feel: informal, laid back kind of celebration. This comes with lots of charity shops itemes, like doillies and tableware, porcelain  figurines, old bottles of pop or cereal, as memorablia. And the must have piece: a record player. Pops of color, tea lenght wedding dress, polka dots, pin-up hair-styles.

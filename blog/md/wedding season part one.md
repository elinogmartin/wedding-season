# Matters to consider

Today, on this beautiful spring day I am taking time to discuss how to choose the wedding venue.

Choosing the venue is considered (by the majority of wedding professionals and brides) the most time consuming and stressful part of wedding planning. 

But really, there should be no surprise, since I believe that the venue is actually setting the tone for your wedding celebrations.

Of course, you can shape it regardless of its unique style or architecture, but keep in mind: there is only so much one can do with something so set in stone.

Also due to lack of thorough consideration, a clash could be created by the style you chose and the existing one at your venue, but we will get into that later. 
The process is as follows: first, you pick the groom and then the venue.

Well, that is a slight exaggeration, but you get the idea: it is vital to book your site before anything else, and anyway there is so little you can do in terms of planning before you book your venue.
I think that every good thing starts with a **budget**, so:

Advice number one: sit down and look at the numbers. Decide right from the beginning where you want to splurge and save up. 
Most of the couples have the cosy set up in mind, so their more substantial investments are on these three: venue, food, music.

Others, with a more adventurous heart, splurge on [travelling with their nearest and dearest](https://www.stylemepretty.com/2017/12/05/relaxed-italian-wedding/) for the wedding. 

Still, some choose their parents' farm, so they save up for a home after their nuptials.
But regardless of the mindset, you may find yourself in; you need a venue, a place to gather to celebrate.

After the budget, a few things will come up, quite essential matters because they are closely connected to your venue deliberations. 

One is the **wedding date**. 
If you are keen on a specific date, something meaningful to you as a couple then the search for your venue will get a little bit more complicated since many of the traditional sites: castles, manor houses, hotels are booked in advance.

The conundrum can be fixed by either changing the date or considering more alternative spaces. 


Don't call quits yet though. 
The latest trends in the wedding industry are moving towards unconventional spaces, like lofts, urban outlets, quirky restaurants, you name it.

This tendency created a lot more variety than before, and another benefit would be that the availability of the traditional settings increased because there's not such high competition anymore on just a few places. 
Now every bride gets to choose according to their couples dynamic.

And so there is hope to book your favourite venue and on your appointed date. 

## Date vs. Location issue

Another matter that arises to think long and hard what is more important to you: the date, maybe you always dreamed of a romantic summer
wedding or ar a magical winter wonderland, and that weighs more than the location. 
Or the opposite could be your case: maybe you want to get married where your parents got married and honour them in this way, or you want to say "I dos" at the inn where you lodged when your fiancee proposed, so **location** trumps.

For me, the season was far more important than the day itself or the location.
 am a very weather orientated person, so I was sure I want, vibrant colours, the sun still shining long and the breezy air. That meant autumn, middle of September. 
 
 And another essential issue that would inevitably come up when discussing the venue is your wedding theme. 
 
 Why? Because again, it very much depends on the existing interior design of the place you pick or the architectural style.
 
 For a cohesive decor, your style an the venue's should coincide.
 
 It would be a shame to replace the chandeliers of a castle for mason jars lightning as it would be just the same bringing velvet tapestry in a barn. 
 
 So, first of all, take this test, read about the different wedding themes and decor, do your homework and after that decide if you are settled on a style, or you would rather pick the location and work with what is there already. 
 I will try and guide you in choosing your venue in two steps.
 
 ## The Big Three
 
 First will be tackling the big three question, and in the next blog post, I will address the possible themes, the details, the decor. 
  
 ### So first answer this: **indoor or outdoor**?
  
  The great outdoor offers an abundance of [stunning natural landscapes](https://greenweddingshoes.com/25-jaw-dropping-spots-that-will-make-you-want-to-elope/), it provides a beautiful backdrop, so you don't need to invest much in decor in this case.
  Besides it makes for such a fun and memorable way of celebrating, in contrast with the more formal fun of a ballroom.
  
  The two significant disadvantages for this location though are the fact that you are at the mercy of the elements (rain, storms, too hot, too cold, etc.). 
  And second, having a bare setting, the rentals will make it a costly affair. Think chair, tables, linen, tableware, etc.

 ### The next question is: are you leaning towards **the countryside or the big city**?

Should it be a barn, manor house, or a castle for the expensive tastes, or a loft, a boutique hotel in the inner busy streets of a city?
Do you want open space and a natural landscape, lawn games, family-inclined festivities or an edgy, [twisty vibe feel for the urbanite](https://junebugweddings.com/wedding-blog/effortless-urban-seattle-wedding-at-axis-pioneer-square/) friends?

The disadvantage in choosing the countryside is the distance that friends and family should travel.

So transportation and accommodation are the pain points. Does your chosen venue offer a solution? 
 
 The disadvantage of the urban wedding is that you will probably have to choose two other places too, one for the ceremony and one for the pictures. 
 So it will be quite a bit of to and fro.

 And another thing to ponder is if an exquisite, niche space, like an art gallery, is suitable for everyone.
 Some of the older members of your family will feel out of their comfort zone.
 
 ### And the last big questions is: do you want a **large affair or an intimate bash**?
 
Will you invite your second cousin and her plus one or do you prefer [just your closest of kin](https://junebugweddings.com/wedding-blog/55-person-miami-wedding-proves-intimate-day-can-majorly-gorgeous/)? 
 You can have the trendiest wedding in the backyard of your childhood home, but most probably it can't host all of the 200 people on your list.
 
So as you well perceived by now, planning a wedding is all about prioritising, you will always have more than two options, and you will always have to weigh their importance. 

This one word makes wedding planning difficult for brides: **prioritising**.

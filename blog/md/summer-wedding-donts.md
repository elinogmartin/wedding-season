In the wedding indsustry, summer is King! 
It has always been, and only a while before, **most** of the weddings were held in late Spring or Summer. In some parts of the world, the tradition is still kept, thus summer being the first choice for brides. Now it seems that the wedding industry is more open to invite the other seasons to the party as well. And I couldn't be more thrilled. But about that later.

For today the plan is to focus on Summer and some tricks to aviod the expected hurdles if you are planning your big day on a beautiful breezy summer day.
Summer's magic consists of amazing light up until late evening, so great shots and longer photo-shoots are in the cards. It opens the door to the great outdoor,to wild flowers galore (even growing your own), to flowy, delicate wedding dresses, and outfits in general.Entertainment wise, with summer you are off to a great start, garden games are always a hit, fire pits and food stations a great way to mingle and therefore, the event loose some of the stiffness characteristic to the formal events.
Well, I know I don't have to sell Summer to you, it has enough fans. But I should warn you that the magic can easily disspates into an ugly sweat. 
Here's some advice to help you keep the magic.

1. As much as you want a poufy dress, or how much you love sleeves,capes or layers, if you get married in the Summer, don't fall for your emotions. Be wise, and get as a I mentioned before, a flowy, light dress that will be comfortable for the minimum eight hours you will have it on. 
This little practicality is a sure way to look gorgeous all throughout the photo-shoot, ceremony aaand party. That you don't sweat and get irritated and exhausted or run constantly to fix your make-up

2. Try to not wear heavy make-up and to avoid strrng colors, because as becoming as they are for an Autumn wedding day or Winter, for Summer, they will be difficult to maintain on a sweltering summer day, and might even clash with the pale, nude, earthy tones of the season. I would advice to pull a Megan Markel.

3. A great idea would be to carry, or have someone carry for you (ðŸ˜† ) a little bag with the essentials: a little bottle of parfume, 
a deodorant, basic make up, water, mints and a snack because the sun can make you dehydrated and it can make you energy fluctuate.It's only a small step from a graceful bride to a Bridezilla and you don't wanna walk it.

4. Do not forget to add fancy, sparkly, long reistant sun block on before you get dressed. Especially if you have an outdoor wedding, but even if you just plan to have those gorgeous portraits shots outside, I would be sure to not get a unwanted tan. And usually fair skin doesn't need long sun exposure to redden.

5. And do you know those funny pictures with "Be smitten, not Bitten", as cute as they are, they are in fact quite practical and essential. Make sure you have bug spray bottles, sun lotion, hats or fans available and in plain sight.

6. Make sure you have flats with you! Those stunning shots you planned during the magical light of dusk will probably need some walking, climbing even, to get to a nice backdrop, to a beautiful poppy field, a moody wood, anything you might have in mind, will take some walking- get flats!

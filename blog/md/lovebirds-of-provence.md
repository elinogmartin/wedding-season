# Lovebirds of Provence

I am reading Les Miserables at the moment, yes, not a summer reading. It is actually a tad gloomy. But still, everything I hear now is French, and all I see is cobblestone streets and fields of lavender, so you can imagine the excitement I got when I received this romantic wedding in Provence from [Nicolas Michiels Photography](http://www.nicolasmichiels.be "Nicolas Michiels Homepage").

Let's say it sent me to a beautiful reverie from which I don't want to wake up, so I keep scrolling.

This beautiful young couple got married in June 2017, on a beautiful summer day in the most romantic European countryside, at [Chateau de Robernier](http://www.chateauderobernier.com/)
The day was a classy, serene affair. With white and blush hues that allowed the venue to shine together with the magnificent nature around it. 
I love the personal details, like the uber cool dancing shoes and the cute design for their wedding favors, the simplicity of their tablescape and the bistro lights. 
Oh, and did I mention I want to move to that gorgeous little chateau?

From the photographer:
> "The wedding of A & E was a  dream for me. When they asked me to join them in the South of France, a place where I have been so often and that I love so much,  to take pictures of their wedding, I was so excited! Provence is one of the most romantic parts of France and Europe.  It is very different from the North of France. The light is intense during the day and so smooth at dusk!

> The family, the place, the weather, the bride and the groom, the wedding dress, everything was just perfect! These two lovers are so chill and peaceful, their love for each other is so intense and generous! This is one of my favorite weddings … abundant emotions, so many smiles, and THIS place !!! AMAZING Provençal old castle  … in the middle of olive trees!

> Destination weddings are always a fantastic adventure. I love spending with couples this small but unforgettable part of their life, full of intense moments, just somewhere on the planet.
For me, each place where I shoot becomes a beautiful memory. I associate people/places and music on my mind, destination weddings truly are unique and suit our hearts."

I hope this wedding will stir your wanderlust feelings and send you to where all the hopeless romantics end up, the South France. Join me there.

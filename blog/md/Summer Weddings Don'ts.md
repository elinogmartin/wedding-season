In the wedding indsustry, summer is King! 
It has always been, and only a while before, **most** of the weddings were held in late Spring or Summer. In some parts of the world, the tradition is still kept.
and the first choice for most brides. Now it seems that the wedding industry is more open to invite the other seasons to the party as well. And I ouldn't be more 
thrilled. But about that later.

For today the plan is to focus on Summer and some tricks to aviod some hurdles if you are planning your big day on a beautiful breezy summer day.
Summer's magic consists of amazing light up until late evening,so great shots and longer photo-shoots sre in the cards. It openes the door to
the great outdoor,to wild flowers galore (even growing your own), to flowy, delicate wedding dresses, and outfits in general.Entertainment wise, with summer you are off to 
a great start, garden games are always a hit, fire pits and food stations a great way to mingle and therefore, the event loose some of the stifness characteristic yo these kind of formal event.
Well, I know I don't have to sell Summer to you, it has enough fans. But I should warn you that the magic can easily disspates into an ugly sweat. 
Soome of advice to help you keep it due so here it is:

1. As much as you want a poufy dress, or how much you love sleeves, or layers, if you get married in the Summer, don't fall for your emotions. Be wise, and 
get as a I mentioned before, a flowy, light dress that will be comfortable for the minimum eight hours ou will have it on. 
In this way you look gorgeous all throughout the photo-shoot, ceremony and party. You don't sweat and get iritated, and you don't run constantly to fix your 
make-up, plus you don't have to be worried of keeping hydrated throughout the day.

2. Try to not wear heavy make-up any way and to avoid storng colors, because as becoming as they are for an Autumn wedding day or Winter, for Summer, they will be difficult to maintain
and might even clash with the pale, nude, earthy tones of the season. I would advice to pull a Megan Markel.

3. A great idea would be to carry, or have someone carry for you (ðŸ˜† ) a little bag with the essentials: a little bottle of parfume, 
a deodorant, basic make up, water, mints and a snack because the sun can make you dehydrated and it can make you energy fluctuate.

4. Do not forget to add fancy, spakly, long reistant sun block on before you get dressed. Especially if you have an outdoor wedding, but even if you just plan
to have those gorgeous portraits shots outside, I would be sure to not get a unwanted tan. And usually fair skin doesn't need long sun exposure to redden.

5. And do you know those funny pictures with "Be smitten, not Bitten", as cute as they are, they are in fact quite practical and essential. Make sure you have bug spray bottles, sun lotion, hats or fans available 
and in plain sight.

6. Make sure you have flats with you! Those stunning shots you planned during the golden hour will probably need some walking, climbing even, to get to a nice backdrop, 
a poppy field, a moody wood, or anything you might have in mind, will take some walking- get flats!

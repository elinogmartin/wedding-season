# Chris and Ira's Wedding Day in Copenhagen
I will start this new feature of sharing with you real weddings to inspire yourself from with my good friends‚Äô beautiful day. 
The idea behind this feature is to get to see what affordable, intimate and bohemian looks like in the wedding industry. 
The real weddings shared will, therefore, have an unconventional, free-spirited vibe to them and usually a budget.

They will sometimes be Instagram worthy with famous vendor teams, and perfect design and photography but sometimes the real weddings
I will be sharing will be DIY affairs with friends and family as vendors, with goofy poses and less glamourous touches but exquisitely 
personal and lovely. I believe that all wedding days have beauty and reverence and I will be honored to share them with you. 
This post will be short. 

Finally, huh? üòÜ And I will just let the pictures talk for themselves. 

Chris and Ira got married on one of the best spring days in Denmark so far, 2nd of May. Blessed with fantastic weather, blue skies a 
calm sea and lovely chirping birds. That‚Äôs exactly what they aimed for, a beautiful, no fuss day with friends, surrounded by the always enchanting nature. 

They wanted a forest as their location, and they got the sea as a bonus. And that was perfect because the couple chose to have a 
minimalist d√©cor allowing nature to shine. And oh how it did.  A beautiful symbiosis of nature‚Äôs green and blue made the day feel
warm intimate, secluded. 

We all enjoyed the emotional ceremony held by our pastor, the lovely groom‚Äôs vows (that had some of us in tears) and the bride‚Äôs sweet
song dedicated to her groom. Of course, it was followed by cake, but the wedding bash is to follow in their respective countries, Mexico
and Ukraine. The disadvantage of being expats ‚Äì you can‚Äôt really fly your bridal party of 100 guests across the world :anguished:, so you have a 
‚Äúroad-show‚Äù :joy:how they called it. #expatlife 

For now, they are basking in their honeymoon, and in the middle of summer, they will travel to celebrate with their families their new 
status as husband and wife. The families actually joined the ceremony via FaceTime, so they laughed and cried with those present thanks
to today‚Äôs technology. 

International couples (or those that choose to elope) are lovely to work with and usually, adventurous, no- fuss kind of bridal couples
because they know well their social circumstances, so there‚Äôs no winging or stress, just happy people, a Yes Hat, kind of bunch. 

I hope you will enjoy and get inspired by this simple yet magical wedding day. The pictures were taken by Vitalii from [IMaker](https://imaker.com.ua/)

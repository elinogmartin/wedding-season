<p>Today I am happy to kick-start a new feature of this blog, that I hope you will find helpful and fun: real weddings features.</p>
<p>I am an avid reader of love stories, and so I read quite a few blog posts that feature real weddings, daily. That's where I get my inspiration from. And that's how I keep updated with the industry trends. I believe that brides are a creative form in themselves, they are able to come up with such magnificent ideas to underline their couples' uniqueness and dynamic. I have read about wedding table runners made out of book pages due to the huge passion of the bride for reading. I have seen tartan napkins to bring about the Scottish
heritage of the groom, and the list can continue and it will. Here. I will give way to brides and other creatives, wedding planners and vendors to inspire you and stir the creative bone in all of us.</p>
<h2>The story</h2>

<p>Today I have Thys and Laneze's love story and planning adventure to share with you, and I am quite sure you will love it as much as I do.</p>
<p>Their story started with a message on a paper when they were in the same class in the fourth grade, a note in which with a funny rhyme Thys asked Laneze to be his girlfriend. On it, Laneze crossed the box for "Yes" and so she became his first girlfriend. They reconnected many years later through a stunning photo of Lanze on Facebook, and what I hear quite a cheeky phone call from Thys at which point they started dating. This love story lived on 2 continents. Thys was living at that time In Denmark and Laneze in South Africa. The story was made complete on a beautiful day in October 2016.</p>

<p>Their wedding day was actually a weekend-long bash with the closest friends and their families in South Africa. Part of the festivities was a barbeque (as I have heard to grill is an active part of the South African identity), a trip in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushveld" rel="external" target="_blank">bushveld</a> and a breakfast in a cave. The main idea behind the day was to have a laid-back celebration, as natural as possible. The day was a beautiful mix between their South African native country and Danish hygge, Denmark being their country of residence, which they so much love.</p>

<p>Thys, the groom, always wanted to get married under a tree, so Laneze found the perfect spot for their wedding ceremony, a majestic Marula also from which seeds were gathered to stand for confetti. An African inspired song was Laneze's entrance (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g9poWKKpbU" rel="external" target="_blank">&quot;We found love&quot;</a> by Lindsey Stirling) and craft beer and dim lights made it all very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygge" rel="external" target="_blank">hyggeligt</a>. You can see for yourselves, because what I have is one absolutely lovely stop-motion that has the magic ability to immerse you in this nature-filled wedding weekend. This was made by the talented photographer: <a href="https://www.whosannah.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Who's Annah</a>.</p>

Today we are taking a trip to lovely Sweden to get inspired by Erika and Romain's intimate and emotional wedding celebration.  Their beautiful day consisted of utter love for the Sweedish nature and tradition, and lots of labor of love in the form of DIY elements in which family and friends alike participated in. 
What I liked most was how the couple kept the day laid-back, laughter- filled and Scandinavian.

The weather was on their side, nature truly shines- with crystal blue water and sky, fields of lush green enclosed by birch trees. And to not mention that Erika and Romain looked dazzling in their bespoke attires. All these details are where my love for rustic, fun and intimate weddings stems from.

					<h1>Services</h1>
					
					<h2>Wedding planners are expensive</h2>
					<p>Well .. everything wedding is expensive. But I truly believe it shouldn't be, unless your taste is quite on the high end and your finances support it, and then expensive is just a way of living not an anxiety trigger.
					<br/>But weddings shouldn't be a financial burden, and planning shouldn't strain our thrifty bone. It should be an amazing season of planning, of stress-free decision making, of playing with design and colors and really just discovering your style as a couple.</p>
					
					<h2>Our dedication is higher than our fees</h2>
					<p>So here is the thing, the idea behind Wedding Season is: <em>save up</em> on the wedding planner's fee, and <em>invest in your style</em>. Buy the pretty dress you wanted but weren't sure if you can afford it after the vendors' fees, get the cute lanterns for your centerpieces, go for the delicious canapes you dreamed of serving. I will walk beside you trying to pull it off for an affordable price.</p>
					
					<h2>Charming weddings, affordable planning</h2>
					<p>Nobody should be cheated of the great opportunity of hiring a wedding planner due to financial concerns. We have great ideas and inspiration, practical tips & tricks, do's and don'ts and a complete vendors list. We would be more than happy to share these with you and just celebrate the amazing day we will be planning together.</p>
					<p>So I guess it can be a win-win, you get professional help at an affordable price and I get to plan (which is my uttermost favorite thing to do) and to be part of your wedding day, which, again, will be a treat for me.</p>
					<p>I absolutely love weddings, everything related to this memorable day, so I want to be there, to get the thrill, emotions, the tears, the laughter, the reverence, to hear the vows and witness love being made complete.</p>
					<p>I came to learn from <a href="/blog/here-comes-the-bride.html">my own wedding</a> how difficult and stressful it can be to plan and execute something you know so little about since you only do it once in a lifetime.</p>

					<h2>Let's meet up!</h2>
					<p>I can work with you <em>from day one</em> or come along the process of planning <em>later on</em>, when you see that the wedding planning anxiety is not receding. Or I can help you <em>on the day itself</em> to make sure your vision comes along and everything runs smoothly.</p>
					<p>Therefore depending on the type of help you might need, a customized  price will be sent to you upon request. I will try and quantify in hours following our first <em>free</em> introductory meeting. My own effort will heavily depend on <em>the size of the wedding</em>, <em>the amount of guests</em> you plan to have and the <em>decor intricacies</em> you desire.
					<br/>But check the three packages I usually work with:</p>
					
					<h3>~ Full service wedding planning</h3>
					<p>This includes designing the event together based on you and your vision, dealing and meeting with vendors, coordinating the wedding day, setting up the venue, cleaning up after, and everything in between.</p>
					
					<h3>~ Consulting</h3>
					<p>I recommend this in case you need to bounce ideas off or you need help in a certain area like budgeting or vendor recommendations, timeline for the big day, or any other scary thing you might think of. The rate per hour is 250 kr including VAT, and this will only be charged, of course, after we have agreed on a plan of help.</p>
					
					<h3>~ Coordinating the wedding day (aka. day-of coordination)</h3>
					<p>This means simply getting the help you need on the wedding day. We will follow your timeline and deal with the vendors, help decorate and clean after.</p>
					
					<p>Please keep in mind that these three predefined packages are not set in stone and we always strive to help you with your specific needs. In any case do <a href="/get-in-touch.html">contact us</a> with any kind of inquiry.</p>

        <p>I hereby promise to <em>love</em> every second used to plan, to chat away and execute your vision, to hold it dearly and follow it for better and for worse.</p>
        <p>I promise to always talk with <em>grace</em>, answer every email, calm every doubt, straighten up every naughty napkin.</p>
        <p>I will earnestly bring the best design from within you. Guide you in being yourselves through and through.</p>
        <p>I promise to spend with you all the time you need, to share in your <em>joy</em> and bring some of my own, to  give you my full attention and strengthen your imagination and creativity.</p>
        <p>Be sure of my <em>kindness</em>, immeasurable passion for weddings, and  my dedication to yours.</p>
        <p>I pledge to bargain for you. To get you any possible discount, regardless of how much I dislike asking for handouts. But I will do it. For you. You deserve not only the best service but the best cooperation and support too.</p>
        <p>I promise to be your rock in case of unmatched chairs, or venue cancellation. To bring <em>peace</em> and fairy lights during the long months of planning and deciding.</p>
        <p>To work with <em>patience</em> and to be willing to face all the changes, revisions, and guest additions.</p>
        <p>Though I will share all my Pinterest boards with you, I will <em>gently</em> draw you back to your budget limits, making sure you respect it.</p>
        <p>I give you my word, I won't desert you in case of Bridezilla features arising in you, I will even knit socks for you in case cold feet.</p>
        <p>I will <em>faithfully</em> serve the richer and poorer, and no matter what, I will count your benefit higher than my fee.</p>
        <p>I grant you my skills and the best my abilities.</p>
        <p>My friendship shall envelop our working relationship and I will strive to be a blessing.</p>
        <p>I value your quirks and your traits, your passions and your hobbies, I plan to make them shine on your big day, allowing them to shape, color and make it memorable.</p>
